ABOUT

This is a chrome extension that lets you read plain HTML pages that by default
extend to fit the page's width. This is very unpleasant to read. This is why
I created this very simple extension that simply adds the following tags to
the body tag of the current HTML page:

    style=max-width=80ch;margin:auto;

Since the script is so simple it will only work for plain HTML pages and pages
with minimum CSS laying-out. To be honest those pages are mostly fine so I
don't care, it's really the plain HTML that's the problem.

INSTALLATION

Unfortunately I can not upload this extension to Chrome Web store because
registering a new developer account requires $5 fee and at the same time
transactions from my country are blocked. So you'll need to do a workaround way

If you manage to upload this extension to Chrome Web Store somehow, please
contact me and I'll put the link here.

1. Clone the code.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and tick "developer mode" on the top of the page
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the "src" folder.
4. You have installed the extension

USAGE

If you find yourself on a troublesome page with very wide text just click on
the Breader extension icon.
